      From the moment I met you, my life changed in the most incredible ways. Your beauty, both inside and out, leaves me in awe every single day. You bring out the best in me, encouraging me to reach new heights and to see the world through a lens of love and optimism. I am endlessly grateful for your unwavering support, your understanding, and the way you make every day an adventure. Being with you has taught me the true meaning of love, and I am dedicated to making you as happy as you make me. You are my everything, and I am so lucky to have you in my life. I am in the mood to be called honey,love,baby.... my angel. You are mine and only mine, all rights are reserved to me only.😘

      P.S. Of all the things I can do on this earth, I want to build a bridge from my heart to your.

      My heart is no more mine, you made it yours....❤️
